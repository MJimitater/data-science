'main.ipynb' contains main code for linear regression analysis

'test.ipynb' is basically junk, just testing things out

'git2net_tutorial.db' is the virgin sqlite db file, what you get when mining the TLP repository.. I added this so mining must not be done every single time again when running main.ipynb

'git2net-tutorial (Kopie).db' is linked into the main.ipynb.. its a copy of the virgin db file and is used to do all the changes on the database, without destroying the virgin db file. 
If a Notebook-reset is necessary, just delete 'git2net_tutorial (Kopie).db' and make a fresh copy from the virgin db 'git2net_tutorial.db', conveniently naming it 'git2net_tutorial (Kopie).db' again.

'visualization.ipynb' contains all the code to visualize the mined data (the code snippets orginate from the git2net tutorial)
